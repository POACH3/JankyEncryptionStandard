# Ceasar Cipher
Allowed characters currently are all ASCIIs from 32 to 122, but I may change this.

Could use some fine tuning, but this is essentially fully functional. 

# RSA
I have no doubt that I am checking for primes in the most inefficient way possible.

Currently this generates primes of up to 10 digits long, which can create 64-bit RSA keys.
