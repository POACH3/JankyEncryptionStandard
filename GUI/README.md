# User Interface
Currently partially functional.

Ceasar Cipher - fully functional
RSA - partially implemented
AES - not implemented

This is intended to be used along side another program, so it is small and simple.

## Planned Features
This GUI is bare bones. The user will be able to select different encryption types and generate keys (and use their own in the case of AES). There will be a light and dark mode.

## Possible Future Features
Some way to output information directly to another program.
Export as a radio mode (RTTY, JS8, FT8, morse code).
Export an audio file.
