# User Interface
Currently partially functional.

This is intended to be used along side another program, so it is small and simple.

## Implemented Features
- Ceasar Cipher - shift selection, encrypt, decrypt
- RSA - key generation, use keys from another source, encrypt, decrypt
- AES - key generation, encrypt, decrypt
- Morse Code - encrypt, decrypt, play Morse message
- Light, dark, and night modes 

## Planned Features
- AES (use keys from another source)

Notes on things to correct:
- change copy and paste buttons to images instead of text
- shrink height of menu bar
- fix color of flyout and picker options
- change menu color on theme change
- add alerts for illegal actions
- remove editor and entry underline highlight

## Possible Future Features
- Some way to output information directly to another program.
- Export as a radio mode (RTTY, JS8, FT8, morse code).
- Export an audio file.
