# Janky Encryption Standard (JES)
The intent of JES is to provide some familiarity with methods of encryption.

A simple GUI provides the functionality of the encryption schemes that have been experimented with.

# Current functionality
**JES has terrible implementations of the following:**

- Ceasar Cipher
- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)         (needs some work)
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- Morse Code
 
# Future additions
**Depending on how ambitious I feel, I may attempt the following:**

- Elliptic-curve Cryptography (ECC)
- Digital signature
- A post-quantum cryptographic scheme (Kyber, Dilithium, or Falcon)
- Audio encryption
- Steganography
