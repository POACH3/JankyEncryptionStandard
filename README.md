# Janky Encryption Standard (JES) purpose
JES is an experiment to provide coding experience for myself as well as to provide some familiarity with methods of encryption.

# Current JES functionality
**JES has terrible implementations of the following:**

- Ceasar Cipher

# Possible additions to JES functionality
**Depending on how ambitious I feel, I may attempt to implement the following:**

- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- Elliptic-curve Cryptography (ECC)
- Audio encryption
- Steganography

# Testing
... I haven't.
