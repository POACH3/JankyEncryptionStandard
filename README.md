# Janky Encryption Standard (JES)
JES is an experiment to provide coding experience for myself as well as to provide some familiarity with methods of encryption.


# Current JES functionality
**JES has terrible implementations of the following:**

- Ceasar Cipher
- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) (work in progress)

 
# Possible future additions to JES
**Depending on how ambitious I feel, I may attempt to implement the following:**

- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- Elliptic-curve Cryptography (ECC)
- Audio encryption
- Steganography
- A VERY simple GUI (lower priority)


# Testing
... I haven't. But... I will? ...I will....  ...I will! ...I WILL. Probably.
