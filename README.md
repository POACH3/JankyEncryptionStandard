# Janky Encryption Standard (JES)
The intent of JES is to provide some familiarity with methods of encryption.

# Current JES functionality
**JES has terrible implementations of the following:**

- Ceasar Cipher
- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)         (needs some work)
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)  (needs some work)

>There is a console app as well as a GUI (console app is being used for testing, GUI is a work in progress)
 
# Possible future additions to JES
**Depending on how ambitious I feel, I may attempt to implement the following:**

- Elliptic-curve Cryptography (ECC)
- Audio encryption
- Steganography
